Hi, I am Palash. An open source developer and programming language enthusiast interested in distributed systems. I enjoy building backend services and developer tools and contributing to open source projects in my free time. You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/palash25/) and [Openhub](https://www.openhub.net/accounts/palash25).

I have been writing open source / production grade code since 2018. I started out with Python as my primary programming language but soon my curiousty made me explore other langauges as well. Most of the code that I get paid to write is in Go besides Go I have also written some Ruby and these days I am tinkering with Rust, Clojure, Elixir, Zig, Nim, Pony, etc.

Besides programming langauges my newfound interests include distributed systems (especially databases), web assembly and infrastructure engineering. I am always on the lookout for challenging projects and work opportunities that include one or more of my aforementioned interests. If you would like to hire me feel free to reach out through [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/palash25/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/palash2504) or email: palash-at-fastmail-dot-com
