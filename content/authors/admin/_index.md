Hi, I am Palash. An open source developer and programming language enthusiast interested in distributed systems, tooling and systems programming. I mostly write REST APIs (trying to learn more about gRPC these days) and dev tools. I can write code in Go, Rust, Ruby and Python but I am also interested in and learning C, Erlang, Ocaml, Nim, Elixir etc.

I was first introduced to programming in school using LOGO which was fun. Afterwards we were also taught Basic and Java which I liked at first but the school along with its curiculum was successful in turning even programming into a boring chore. I rediscovered my love for programming once I started my undergrad.

In college I was introduced to open source software. The idea of being able to read and modify the source code of a software fascinated me. After months of struggle I made my first contribution in the form of a DuckDuckGo instant answer (lookup Lolcode Cheat Sheet on DDG to see it in action) and ever since then I haven't looked back.

Open source contributions opened up a lot of opportunities for me. Besides being able to hack on various different codebases I was also offered paid gigs to work on open source software by orgs like [coala](https://coala.io) under Google Summer of Code '18, [Appbase](https://appbase.io) as an intern and [CNCF](https://cncf.io) under the Community Bridge Programme.

I have also interned at a startup called [Atlan](https://atlan.com/). My experience there was a mixed bag but I got to work on this really cool product called [Collect](https://collect.atlan.com/) rewriting the Analytics API for Collect in Go which will probably never go on production because of the poor management.

Currently I am familiarizing myself with functional programming and studying more about distributed systems. I am looking for internships/full-time opportunities where I will get to work on building highly available and scalable services using distributed systems concepts and modern DevOps practices.
