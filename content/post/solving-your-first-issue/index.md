There were multiple reasons that prompted me to write this post.
- The internet is filled with a plethora of "Getting Started With Open Source Contributions" guide which only tell you to "fork, clone and make a PR" but never talk about the "make a PR" part or the process of understanding the issue and writing the patch for it. Even I tried to take a stab at writing an [article](https://opensource.com/article/18/4/get-started-open-source-project) like those.
- "How to get started with open source?" is a question that I get asked very often (almost everyday) on Linkedin and I have been meaning to dump all my knowledge on this subject into a post for more than 2 years now.
- I really like the approach that infosec engineers take while documenting their exploits (like decompiling the apk, grepping through the app code to search for a particular string). Makes the craft more accessible to begineers, I aim to do something similar with this post.
