Are you a student/undergrad/newbie coder? Ever felt under-confident when you ask yourself the question "Am I a professional software developer"? I don't think there is a checklist that lists out requirements for being able to call oneself a software developer so in this post like most of my other post I will talk about my own transition from a newbie programmer who constantly doubted his own abilities to someone who can claim to be a developer.

> Aside: The terms "coder" or "programmer" in this post are not used in a derogatory way. I have seen lots of senior devs describe themselves simply as programmers online, I just needed a term to refer to newbies.
