I have been wanting to write about GSoC for quite sometime. Like most of my blog posts I wanted this one to be a little different too focussing mostly on things that aren't talked about in other GSoC posts. So besides talking about "things that might help you get selected for GSoC" I would also be pointing out a few misconceptions and some general advice that never gets talked about.
