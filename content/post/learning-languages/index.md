In the last year or so I feel like I have grown as a developer. I keep track of my growth through....I am not sure what word to use for it but for now let's call them realizations.

One of the most important realizations I have had lately is that I had been looking at programming langauges the wrong way in terms of *what things to focus on while learning a new language?*, *why should I learn this language?* and *how to learn a new language? (can the method I used for learning Go work while learning Rust?)*. This post will follow the following format:
- A short description of the language and its features
- What to focus on while learning the language.
- Why did I decide to learn or why do I want to learn that specific language
- How did I learn the language.

# Why learn another language?
I learn langauges for a multitude of reasons:
- Exploring a new paradigm: You have already programmed using procedural/imperative (C or Go) and OOP (like Python or Java) langauges but now you want to exlpore functional programming (Haskell or SML) or logic programming (using Prolog)
- Opportunity to re-invent the wheel:
- Learning about a specialized field: TLA+
- Interest in type theory
- Interest in concurrency models - STM, CSP,
