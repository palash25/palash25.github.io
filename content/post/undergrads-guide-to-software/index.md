In this post I will talk about how I navigated 4 years of my undergrad, things that I benifitted from, mistakes I made and some general advice for aspiring software developers. This guide will not guarentee you success in your career but will try to give you a sense of direction.

- dont go overboard
- don't beat yourself up
- focus on short term goals but have long term goals at the back of your head
- go to conferences
- start/contribute to a local community
- learn multiple programming languages

## Audience
This post is targetted at the following people:
- If you are about to start your undergrad.
- If you are already a few years into your undergrad and are utterly confused as to where to start from (this was the case with me a few years ago)
- If you have recently completed your undergrad and are stuck in a job that you hate and want to do all the things that you missed out on in those 4 years.

## Forget about it

If you have just started college and didn't get the college / branch that you had hoped for because of low scores in the entrance exams then you better shake it off and move on. I have come across people who dwell on their failure in the entrance exam and obsess over their friend's or acquaintance's success too much. So much so that they end up doing this till the end of their undergrad. For me it was easy to forget about it since I had no expectations from my JEE Advanced results and coming to college felt like a pleasent change. 

Scoring low on an exam, not getting admitted to your dream college is not the death of your career. If you are still beating yourself over your scores its time to stop, it will only slow you down further and you will let your fears get the best of you.

## Getting started

It doesn't take much to get yourself started with writing code.
